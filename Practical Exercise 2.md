## Practical Exercise 2: Bug Hunt and Fix

## Exercise instructions:


1. Open the file buggy_customer_management.py in your editor. 
   This file contains intentional bugs. Your task is to identify and fix these bugs. 
2. As you find each bug, log it by adding a comment above the bug with the format: # BUG {number}: {description} - Line {line_number} 
3. Fix the bug in the code. 
4. After you've gone through the entire file, run it to see if you've caught all the bugs. 
    Compare your findings with the solution to see if you missed any bugs.
